# Contributing to pi

We emphatically welcome bug reports, issues you may encounter, documentation, and pull requests. We also welcome feature
requests, though whether we will incorporate them depends on how much time
contributors have.

## Getting started

If you'd like ideas for ways to contribute, check out `TODO.md`. Feel free to
open a PR or an issue if you want guidance on how to implement something.

## Rules etc.
As a reminder, we follow the [rust standards of
conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html), with the addendum that
we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment
regardless of sex worker status or previous sex worker status. 

In addition, please be aware that not everyone speaks English as a first
language and assume best intent when possible.
